This  Tic-Tac-Toe AI game utilizes Python's Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface. 
Tkinter simplifies the development of GUI applications and provides tools for creating buttons, frames, and event handling. 
Functions are used to manage various aspects of the game, including changing game modes (single player or multiplayer), updating the game board, and checking for win or draw conditions. 
The minimax algorithm is employed to determine the computer player's moves in single-player mode, ensuring optimal gameplay. 
This algorithm recursively evaluates possible moves to find the best strategy while considering the opponent's moves. 
Overall, the code offers an interactive gaming experience, allowing users to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer opponent or with another player, enhancing their understanding of GUI development and game logic implementation in Python.
