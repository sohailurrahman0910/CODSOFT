This project is about a simple rule-based chatbot in Python. The chatbot interacts with users by responding to various types of queries and prompts, such as greetings, inquiries about its identity, jokes, weather queries, etc. The chatbot's responses are predefined based on specific keywords or phrases detected in the user's input. The code utilizes basic Python functions for capturing user input, processing it using conditional statements, and generating appropriate responses. Users can engage in conversation with the chatbot until they choose to end the interaction by typing "bye". The code can be further extended and customized to enhance the chatbot's functionality and response capabilities.
