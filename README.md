# CodSoft - AI Internship

# TASK-1:  CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Build a basic chatbot capable of engaging in simple conversations. It responds to greetings, provides information about itself, shares jokes and interesting facts, and offers the current time upon request. Users can interact with the chatbot The chatbot continues the conversation until the user types "bye" to exit. It's a beginner-friendly project suitable for learning about natural language processing and basic AI concepts. This project serves as an educational resource for Python developers interested in creating their own chatbots.

# TASK-2:   TIC-TAC-TOE AI GAME

This project is about a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent. The game is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player can challenge an AI opponent based on the minimax algorithm, providing a challenging experience. The game interface is intuitive and visually appealing. Players can restart the game at any point and enjoy seamless gameplay. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of implementing AI algorithms in a classic game scenario. It's a fun and educational project for both beginners and intermediate Python developers interested in game development and AI.

# TASK-3:   FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION SYSTEM

This project is about a face detection and recognition system implemented using Python and OpenCV. The system utilizes the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time video streams from a webcam. Upon detection, the system draws bounding boxes around the detected faces. It serves as a foundational project for understanding computer vision techniques and can be extended for facial recognition applications by integrating with face recognition libraries such as OpenCV's face recognition module. The system offers real-time face detection and is suitable for educational purposes, research, and development of facial recognition systems.
